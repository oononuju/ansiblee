minor_changes:
- ssh-agent - InventoryManager is capable of spawning or reusing an ssh-agent, allowing plugins to interact with the ssh-agent.
  Additionally a pure python ssh-client has been added, enabling easy interaction with the agent. The ssh connection plugin contains
  new functionality via ``ansible_ssh_private_key`` and ``ansible_ssh_private_key_passphrase``, for loading an SSH private key into
  the agent from a variable.
