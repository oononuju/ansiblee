bugfixes:
  - Set new default Vault method to take the place of the, now deemed week, AES256 method.
  - Added extra validation for certain Vault parameters.
  - Vault's salt configuration had it's documentation updated to clarify scope and usage.
  - When writing vault output to stdout and it is a tty, ensure we line break to avoid message overlap.
minor_changes:
  - Created a configuration to select the Vault method to use for encryption.
    The old AES256 method can still be chosen, for backwards compatibility.
  - The ``vault`` filter plugin was updated to have a method option.
  - Internal vault API were changed to streamline vault method updates in the future.
  - Encapsulated ciphertext handling into the ciphers, mitigating the need for future changes to the API.
